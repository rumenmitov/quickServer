## Prerequisites âœ…
- [x] [node & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
--------------
## Installation & Setup ðŸ“¸  
1. Clone the repository and move / copy it to `/usr/local/bin`  
2. Execute the following commands:  
```  
cd /usr/local/bin/quickServerProject
sudo npm install
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/quickServerProject/quickServer  
sudo cp /usr/local/bin/quickServerProject/quickServer /usr/local/bin  
```  
3. Now you can run it with `quickServer file_path`, where instead of *file_path* you put the **absolute** file path of the html file that you want to host
4. You can now find your website on **localhost:3000**  
### Vim Usage  
If you are editing a html document in vim and want to quickly host it, add the following to your *.vimrc* file:  
```  
command QuickServer !quickServer %:p  
```   
Save your configuration and you can now host the html page with the following vim command: `:QuickServer`   
**NOTE:** Make sure you have *sudo* priveleges beforehand (i.e. try `sudo vim`, exit and then open your html file)!  

-----------------  
## Further Information ðŸ“–
The server is hosted in the background and you can run `ps aux | grep 'node'` to find its process id. You can then kill the process with: `sudo kill -9 process_id`. Make sure to replace *process_id* with the process id from the **ps aux** command.  
**NOTE:** The server remains active until you close your terminal.
